[{"id":"1","title":"Extending Hjem","content":"Extending Hjem {#extending-hjem} The core strength of Hjem lies in its simplicity. No more intricate APIs for you to parse through just to understand some basic feature. This should, however, not be seen as a weakness of Hjem. Projects such as Hjem Rum should be seen as proof just how much you may build upon Hjem, and just how robust it is. Writing your own modules {#writing-hjem-modules} You may freely consume the APIs exposed by Hjem to write your own modules, primarily to fill the gap between a comprehensive (and clunky) module system like Home Manager and something as quick and streamlined as Hjem. To do so, you must write your own Hjem modules. Those modules will be evaluated by Hjem to make more options, such as or as you might be used to from other module systems, once they are imported. The NixOS Manual covers very comprehensively how to write your own modules. For the sake of brevity, we will only cover the basics required to write a valid Hjem module, and how you may integrate it with Hjem as a separate module system. The anatomy of a Hjem module is simple. You want to define , and you want to set based on those options. Here is an example from Hjem Rum's FZF module : is the critical component here, as it will make options such as available for user configurations. The other component, , sets values in Hjem's own field and Hjem Rum's and fields which, in turn, set files such as and . Let's assume you have defined a similar module in in your configuration. You may consume it in your NixOS configuration by first importing Hjem as a NixOS module, and adding it to Hjem's {option} in order to be evaluated. Once you create and import your module, you are done. It all boils down to defining a valid module, and consuming it in {option} . You may also choose to export your defined modules as in your if you want to allow others to use them too!","path":"extending.html","tokens":["make","like","clunky","once","through","much","quick","the","cover","how","consume","for","manual","brevity","define","defined","create","writing-hjem-modules","imported","are","here","which","others","understand","build","write","may","component","nixos","available","this","fields","option","down","hjem","gap","modules","core","integrate","apis","used","very","fzf","basic","assume","not","options","proof","home","robust","required","valid","systems","turn","projects","manager","your","module","must","values","rum","they","some","freely","other","order","them","too","sake","export","extending","should","fill","its","user","will","parse","with","sets","have","consuming","upon","adding","and","intricate","all","want","let","separate","allow","feature","first","primarily","import","just","use","more","files","exposed","configuration","defining","anatomy","configurations","you","seen","however","comprehensively","set","example","simple","based","importing","might","boils","extending-hjem","simplicity","something","only","system","weakness","own","writing","from","covers","critical","similar","evaluated","field","lies","done","between","comprehensive","those","basics","such","streamlined","choose","strength","also"],"title_tokens":["extending","hjem"]},{"id":"2","title":"Index","content":"Index Preface {#preface} Welcome to the Hjem documentation. This online manual aims to describe how to get started with, use, and extend Hjem per your needs. [!TIP] We also provide a short module option reference . Hjem does not vendor any modules similar to Home-Manager and Nix-Darwin, but there exists a companion project that aims to bridge the gap between Hjem and per-program modules. If you are interested in such a setup, we encourage you to take a look at Hjem Rum This page is still in early beta. If you think some things should be better explained, or find bugs in the site please report them over our issue tracker . Installing Hjem The primary method of installing Hjem is through Nix Flakes . To get started, you must first add Hjem as a flake input in your . Hjem is distributed as a NixOS module for the time being, and you must import it as such. For the sake of brevity, this guide will demonstrate how to import it from inside the call. Usage Hjem achieves its signature simplicity and robustness by shaving off the unnecessary complexity and the boilerplate. Instead we expose a simple interface used to link files: {option} . This is the core of Hjem―file linking. {option} is the main entry point used to declare individual users for Hjem. It contains several sub-options that may be used to control Hjem's behaviour per user. You may refer to the option documentation for more details on each bell and whistle. Important options to be aware of are as follows: {option} allows toggling file linking for individual users. Set to by default, but can be used to toggle off file linking for individual users on a multi-tenant system. {option} is the name of the user that will be defined. This must be set in your configuration. To avoid making assumptions, Hjem does not infer this from . {option} is your home directory. Files in will always be relative to this directory. {option} decides whether Hjem should override if a file already exists at a target location. This default to , but this can be enabled for all users by setting {option} to . Example Now, let's go over an example. In this case we have a user named \"alice\" whose home directory we are looking to manage. Alice's home directory is , so we should first tell Hjem to look there in the configuration. Since defined users are enabled by default, no need to set explicitly. Once Hjem has some information about the user, i.e., the username and the user's home directory, we can give Hjem some files to manage. Let's go over Hjem's file linking capabilities with some basic examples. You can use to create a file at a given location with the attribute as its contents. For example we can set to create and it's contents will read \"Hello World\". Similar to NixOS' , Hjem supports a attribute with which you can link files from your store. For example we can use Nixpkgs' writers to create derivations that will be used as the source. A good example would be using . With the above example, you can link the store path resulting from in , with the contents \"file contents\". Do note, the attribute also supports passing paths directly: In this case will be copied to the store, and will be a symlink to its store location. The most recent addition to Hjem's file linking interface is the attribute. It allows feeding a generator by which your values will be transformed. Consider the following example: The result in will be the JSON representation of the attribute set provided in . This is helpful when you are writing files in specific formats expected by your programs. You could, say, use to write a TOML configuration file in This, of course, works with other formats and generators as well. Bringing it together Now that we have gone over individual examples, here is a more complete example to give an idea of the bigger picture. By using (or abusing, up to you) the submodule you can write files anywhere in your home directory. With such a configuration, we can expect three files: with the contents \"bar\" with the contents \"file contents\" with the contents Using Hjem To Install Packages {#installing-packages} Hjem exposes an experimental interface for managing packages of individual users. At its core, is identical to as found in Nixpkgs. In fact, to avoid creating additional environments Hjem maps your to .
